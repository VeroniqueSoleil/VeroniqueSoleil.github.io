Birth of the Internet marks the realization of people’s connection.
Though having been born for several decades, the Internet has never really been utilized effectively.
It is exhilarating that we are keeping and will keep trying.
Great changes have taken place everywhere, including education and communication— these are what we are concentrating on.
Globalization has taught us that there will be various answers under various contexts; what really matters is perspective.
Thus, learning from whom, for what purpose, in what place, by what method plays the key role of being a multipotentialite.
Getting out of our comfort zone to start something new, exploring the culture in a country that is fresh to us, embracing the boom of ideas from everywhere at any time—these are what we are going to offer.
**From Internet to Tritry, from China to the world, we are all on the road.**
