We would like to divide our story into two parts.

One is about the past; the other is about the future.

In the past, through decades of efforts, we finally settled down on the land of the US.

Then, the next task was and, actually, is and will be the education of our next generation.

Because they are all born in the US, letting them know their motherland, China, becomes a tough job.

We always hope that they can learn more from their motherland. 

In addition, through the communication with their peers, we also learn that the young generation in the US are  remarkably interested in China.

Thus, with our primary goal of bringing more opportunities of studying in China, we set up our company.

Then, we are going to tell you the future part.

We would also like to use two "past stuffs" to indicate it.

One is the "Gold Rush" in American history.

We all know that it is one of the parts in the "Westward Movement".

About the future, we dare to foresee that there will be a "Gold Rush" in an "Eastward Movement".

We do not even bother to prove it, because you can find the evidence from the daily international broadcasts-- the economy, industry, science and technology in China all have a promised future.

Therefore, knowing Chinese language and culture is the key factor of making fortune in your future-- you are going to make deals with Chinese people.

The other past stuff I would like to show you is maintained by the Cleveland Museum of Art-- *Streams and Mountains without End*, a Northern Song handscroll from China.

Inspired by it, Gary Snyder, an American man of letters who perhaps is best known as a poet, comes out a poem called *Endless Streams and Mountains*.

In it, you could see these lines:

> Walking on walking, under foot earth turns.

> Streams and mountains never stay the same.

The endless realm inside the Chinese painting seems to impress him a lot.

From this handscroll, what we want to tell you is that, as for "endlessness", our history, culture, business , population, opportunities... are of the similar quality.

Or, at least, you can enjoy the real landscape of endless streams and mountains in China.

After the story, you may ask:"How about the present?"

The present belongs to you and must be your own story.

**To start your present story and to write the future story with us, every journey of thousand miles begins with your first step in Tritry.**
