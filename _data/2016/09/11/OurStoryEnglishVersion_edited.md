We would like to divide our story into two parts.

One is about the past; the other is about the future.

In the past, after decades of effort, we finally settled down on the land of the US.

Then, the next task was, and actually will be, the education of our next generation.

Because they are all born in the US, letting them know their motherland, China, becomes a tough job.

We always hope that they can learn more from their heritage.

In addition, through the communication with their peers, we also learn that the young generation in the US is remarkably interested in China.

Thus, with our primary goal of bringing more opportunities of studying in China, we found our company.

Now, we are going to tell you the part in the future.

We would also like to use two references to the past to indicate the future.

One is the "Gold Rush" in American history.

We all know that it is one of the parts in the "Westward Movement".

About the future, we dare to foresee that there will be a "Gold Rush" in an "Eastward Movement".

We do not even bother to prove it, because you can find the evidence from the daily international news-- the fast growing economy, consumer market, science and technology.

Therefore, knowing Chinese language and culture provides personal fulfillment and career opportunity-- you are going to interact with Chinese people.

The other reference to the past we would like to bring up is maintained by the Cleveland Museum of Art-- Streams and Mountains without End, a Northern Song hand-scroll from China.

Gary Snyder, an American man who perhaps is best known as a poet, Inspired by it, comes out a poem called *Endless Streams and Mountains*.

In it, you could see these lines:

> Walking on walking, under foot earth turns.

> Streams and mountains never stay the same.

The endless realm inside the Chinese painting seems to impress him a lot.

From this hand-scroll, what we want to tell you is that, as for "endlessness", our history, culture, business , population, opportunities... are of very similar quality.

Or, at least, you can enjoy the real landscape of endless streams and mountains in China.

After the story, you may ask:"How about the present?"

The present belongs to you and must be your own story.

**To start your present story and to write the future story with us, every journey of thousand miles begins with your first step in Tritry.**
